# squarry-go-round-granular

This is the original squarry go round. It is has more granular control over the motion
of the squares than the successor. The second gen squarry go round uses CSS transition
over javascript arrays. I actually prefer the original even though it is more code. I 
am able to control the rate at which the squares move and no square moves until the 
previous square has finished moving. I created the CSS heavy squarry_go_round to see if
I could simplify the code. There's another animation class to consider to make the code 
simpler and possible even smoother from frame to frame.
